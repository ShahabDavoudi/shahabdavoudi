I have actively pursued professional development opportunities to expand my knowledge and proficiency in advanced analytical techniques. Throughout 2022, I participated in several intensive virtual training courses organized by the prestigious Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics (IBB) at the University of Tehran. These courses provided me with comprehensive training in principles and applications of cutting-edge instrumental methods, including Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Fluorescence Spectroscopy, Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy, Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectra Interpretation, Mass Spectrometry, Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) for protein analysis, and UV-Visible Absorption Spectroscopy. By obtaining certificates of attendance for these courses, I have reinforced my theoretical understanding and hands-on expertise in state-of-the-art analytical instrumentation, equipping me with invaluable skills for my future research endeavors.
