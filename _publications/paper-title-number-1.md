This Article presents the gasification of cigarette butt waste using supercritical water technology to produce hydrogen fuel. Cigarette butts contain cellulose acetate fibers and accumulate over 4.5 trillion non-biodegradable units annually, posing major environmental hazards. Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) provides a promising solution for converting this waste into usable hydrogen gas. The effect of temperature, reaction time and feedstock concentration on gas composition and hydrogen yield were studied experimentally . Increasing the temperature from 380°C to 420°C significantly improved hydrogen production from 13.5% to 22.1% mole fraction by promoting favorable water-gas shift and steam reforming reactions. Prolonged reaction times also enhanced hydrogen yield by allowing the steam reforming reactions to further progress towards equilibrium. However, excessive feedstock concentrations beyond 3 wt% led to slower kinetics and lower efficiencies likely due to restricted mass transfer. A Ni-Al2O3 catalyst was assessed to accelerate the water-gas shift reaction for increased hydrogen production. An optimal 10 wt% catalyst loading doubled the hydrogen yield to 39.6%, but additional amounts declined performance likely due to aggregation effects restricting active sites. Attaining the proper balance of decomposition pathways and equilibria is essential to steering SCWG towards optimal hydrogen generation .This Article demonstrates the promise of SCWG for converting hazardous cigarette butt waste into usable hydrogen gas. Optimized conditions of 420°C, 30 min reaction time and 2.74 wt% feed were found to maximize the hydrogen yield. If efficiency challenges can be addressed, the economics and environmental benefits are substantial. Ongoing research to elucidate detailed reaction mechanisms is important for optimization.
