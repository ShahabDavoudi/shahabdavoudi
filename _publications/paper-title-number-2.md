This study investigates the production of hydrogen from distillery wastewater through the supercritical water gasification process. A comprehensive simulation model was developed to predict the product yields and operating conditions for optimal hydrogen generation. The effects of key parameters such as temperature, pressure, and feed concentration on the gasification process were thoroughly analyzed. Machine learning techniques, specifically artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms, were employed to optimize the process conditions and maximize hydrogen yield. The models were trained using experimental data from lab-scale supercritical water gasification trials with distillery wastewater. The simulation results provide valuable insights into the complex reaction pathways and enable the identification of optimal operating windows for efficient hydrogen production from this waste stream. The integration of machine learning algorithms allows for accurate prediction and optimization of process performance, paving the way for sustainable energy recovery from distillery effluents.
