This study aims to elucidate the underlying mechanisms governing the production of biofuels from algal biomass and organic waste via a nano-catalytic pyrolysis process. The pyrolysis of these renewable feedstocks is a promising thermochemical route for generating sustainable liquid fuels and chemicals. However, the complex reaction pathways and the role of nano-catalysts in selectively promoting desired product formation are not well understood. Through a systematic investigation, this work unravels the intricate reaction networks and elucidates the catalytic effects of various nano-materials on the pyrolysis process. Advanced analytical techniques are employed to characterize the biomass feedstocks, nano-catalysts, and the resulting bio-oil, allowing for a comprehensive mechanistic analysis. The influence of process parameters, such as temperature, heating rate, and catalyst loading, on product distribution and quality is also explored. Ultimately, this mechanistic study provides valuable insights into optimizing the nano-catalytic pyrolysis process for maximizing biofuel yields from sustainable algal and organic waste resources.
