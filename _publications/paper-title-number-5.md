This study investigates the production of bio-oil (BO) through the direct hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of refinery oily sludge (ROS) in the presence of various catalysts, including cobalt(II) acetate (C4H6CoO4), manganese(II) acetate (C4H6MnO4), antimony(III) acetate(C6H9O6Sb), cobalt(III) acetylacetonate(C4H6MnO4), nickel(II) acetylacetonate(C15H21CoO6), Co/Al2O3, and sodium carbonate(Na₂CO₃), were employed to assess their effects on improving the HTL process. Various weight ratios of catalysts to ROS (10-40 wt%) were tested, and the results were compared with non-catalytic runs. Nickel(II) acetylacetonate, Co/Al2O3, and antimony(III) acetate resulted in the highest BO yields. These catalysts were further investigated under various operating conditions to optimize the process variables, including temperature (275-312.5 °C), reaction time (40-75 min), and ROS content (10-25 wt%). The results showed that the highest BO yield of 75.8 wt% on a dry ash-free basis was achieved at 290 °C, 52.5 min, 16 wt% ROS content, and 40 wt% antimony(III) acetate. Moreover, it was found that antimony(III) acetate successfully produced simple-structure hydrocarbons, but the BO contained a high number of carbon atoms compared to gasoline and diesel. Additionally, BO obtained in the presence of antimony(III) acetate contained hydroxide compounds that can cause corrosion in vehicles.
