About
======

Hello! I'm Shahab Davoudi Kashani, a passionate environmental engineer. As a recent graduate with a Master's degree in Chemical Engineering with a specialization in Environmental Engineering from the University of Tehran, I am driven by a deep commitment to sustainable solutions for a better tomorrow.


My main research interests include:

Hydrothermal Conversion of Wastes
Pyrolysis
Waste Conversion
Catalysis
Machine Learning for Process Optimization
Simulation

My Background and Journey
======
After receiving my Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Tehran, where my thesis explored the construction and performance of photovoltaic cells, I continued my academic journey at the same institution. Driven by a passion for environmental stewardship, I pursued a Master's degree in Chemical Engineering with a specialization in Environmental Engineering. My thesis focused on the hydrothermal gasification of cigarette filters for hydrogen production, showcasing my commitment to innovative waste conversion technologies.

During my studies, I actively engaged in research projects, including simulating hydrogen production from distillery wastewater, investigating refinery waste conversion to bio-oil, and studying the pyrolysis of algal biomass and organic waste. These experiences have shaped my commitment to finding sustainable solutions to environmental challenges.

Sustainable Solutions for a Better Tomorrow
======

Through conferences, workshops, and consultations, I actively contribute to the global dialogue on waste conversion, renewable energy, and sustainable development. My ultimate goal is to leverage my expertise and passion to create a more sustainable future for generations to come.

Seeking PhD Opportunities
