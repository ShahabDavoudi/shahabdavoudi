Thermochemical conversion of waste
======


Hydrothermal gasification(HTG)
------

My thesis presents the gasification of cigarette butt waste using supercritical water technology to produce hydrogen fuel. Cigarette butts contain cellulose acetate fibers and accumulate over 4.5 trillion non-biodegradable units annually, posing major environmental hazards. Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) provides a promising solution for converting this waste into usable hydrogen gas. The effect of temperature, reaction time, and feedstock concentration on gas composition and hydrogen yield was studied experimentally. Increasing the temperature from 380°C to 420°C significantly improved hydrogen production from 13.5% to 22.1% mole fraction by promoting favorable water-gas shift and steam reforming reactions. Prolonged reaction times also enhanced hydrogen yield by allowing the steam reforming reactions to further progress towards equilibrium. However, excessive feedstock concentrations beyond 3 wt% led to slower kinetics and lower efficiencies likely due to restricted mass transfer. A Ni-Al2O3 catalyst was assessed to accelerate the water-gas shift reaction for increased hydrogen production. An optimal 10 wt% catalyst loading doubled the hydrogen yield to 39.6%, but additional amounts declined performance likely due to aggregation effects restricting active sites. Attaining the proper balance of decomposition pathways and equilibria is essential to steering SCWG towards optimal hydrogen generation. This thesis demonstrates the promise of SCWG for converting hazardous
cigarette butt waste into usable hydrogen gas. Optimized conditions of 420°C, 30 min reaction
time, and 2.74 wt% feed were found to maximize the hydrogen yield. If efficiency challenges can
be addressed, the economics and environmental benefits are substantial. Ongoing research to
elucidate detailed reaction mechanisms is important for optimization.

Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) 
------
This study investigates the production of bio-oil (BO) through the direct hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of refinery oily sludge (ROS) in the presence of various catalysts, including cobalt(II) acetate (C4H6CoO4), manganese(II) acetate (C4H6MnO4), antimony(III) acetate(C6H9O6Sb), cobalt(III) acetylacetonate(C4H6MnO4), nickel(II) acetylacetonate(C15H21CoO6), Co/Al2O3, and sodium carbonate(Na₂CO₃), were employed to assess their effects on improving the HTL process. Various weight ratios of catalysts to ROS (10-40 wt%) were tested, and the results were compared with non-catalytic runs. Nickel(II) acetylacetonate, Co/Al2O3, and antimony(III) acetate resulted in the highest BO yields. These catalysts were further investigated under various operating conditions to optimize the process variables, including temperature (275-312.5 °C), reaction time (40-75 min), and ROS content (10-25 wt%). The results showed that the highest BO yield of 75.8 wt% on a dry ash-free basis was achieved at 290 °C, 52.5 min, 16 wt% ROS content, and 40 wt% antimony(III) acetate. Moreover, it was found that antimony(III) acetate successfully produced simple-structure hydrocarbons, but the BO contained a high number of carbon atoms compared to gasoline and diesel. Additionally, BO obtained in the presence of antimony(III) acetate contained hydroxide compounds that can cause corrosion in vehicles.

Pyrolysis
------

This study delves into the mechanistic intricacies of biofuel production from algal biomass and organic waste via nano-catalytic pyrolysis, an innovative approach aimed at sustainable energy generation. Nano-catalytic pyrolysis involves the utilization of nanoscale catalysts to enhance the pyrolysis process, leading to improved reaction kinetics and product selectivity. Algal biomass and organic waste, as abundant and renewable feedstocks, offer a promising avenue for biofuel synthesis while addressing waste management challenges. Through detailed experimentation and analysis, this research endeavors to unravel the underlying mechanisms driving the nano-catalytic pyrolysis process, shedding light on optimal catalyst compositions, reaction conditions, and product yields.
