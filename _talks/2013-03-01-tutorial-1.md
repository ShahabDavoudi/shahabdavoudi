These catalysts are brought to you through meticulous synthesis techniques to enhance efficiency and sustainability in various conversion processes:

Synthesized Catalysts:

1.	Ni-Al2O3
2.	Co-Al2O3
3.	Ni-Fe-Al2O3
4.	Co-Fe-Al2O3

   
Catalysts Brought from External Sources:

1.	HZSM-5
2.	Ni-HZSM-5
3.	Co-HZSM-5
4.	Mn-HZSM-5
